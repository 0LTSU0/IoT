# IoT

## Code for project work on course  521043S Internet of Things

### Short description:
The server.py is the main script that should be running on some computer pretending to be some kind of a central IoT server (simple and open/close versions, the simple one just turns lights on/off if movement and the other one so that open = turn on and close = turn off). The iotraspb.py is just a simple script to run on a raspberry pi that has argb leds connected to it to function as the light that is controlled in this. In the folder "android" there is the installer apk for a simple android app built with kivy that makes any android smartphone function as a accelometer in the system. The source code for this is the main.py in the same folder.
